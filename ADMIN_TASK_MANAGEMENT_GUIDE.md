# Admin Panel Task Management Guide

This guide explains how to use the task management features in the admin panel.

## Overview

The task management system in the admin panel is designed to handle two main types of tasks:

1. **Regular Tasks** - These are tasks created by admin users for various staff roles (Marketing Staff, Godown Incharge, Mid-Level Manager).
2. **Internal Tasks** - These are tasks created by Marketing Staff and App Developers through the mobile app.

## Task Tabs

The task management interface has two main tabs:

### 1. All Tasks Tab

This tab displays all tasks in the system, regardless of who created them. Here you can:

- Filter tasks by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- Filter tasks by staff role (Marketing Staff, Godown Incharge, Mid-Level Manager)
- Filter tasks by type (System Users, External Users)
- Create new tasks for any staff role
- View, complete, or delete existing tasks

### 2. Internal Tasks (Marketing Staff & App Developer) Tab

This tab shows **only tasks created by Marketing Staff or App Developers**. These are typically tasks created from the mobile app. This tab provides:

- Visibility into tasks that field staff and app developers are creating
- Ability to filter by status and assigned staff member
- Capability to view details, mark as completed, or delete tasks
- Option to create new internal tasks that will appear to Marketing Staff and App Developers

## Creating Tasks

### Creating Regular Tasks

1. Go to the "All Tasks" tab
2. Click "Create Task" button
3. Select the staff role (Marketing Staff, Godown Incharge, Mid-Level Manager)
4. Fill in the task details specific to that role
5. Choose whether to assign to an existing user or external user
6. Click "Create Task"

### Creating Internal Tasks

1. Go to the "Internal Tasks (Marketing Staff & App Developer)" tab
2. Click "Create Internal Task" button
3. Enter the task details
4. Choose whether to assign to an existing user or external user
5. Click "Create Task"

Internal tasks will appear in the mobile app for Marketing Staff and App Developers, and they're designed to be simpler with fewer required fields.

## Viewing Task Details

For any task, you can click the "View" button (eye icon) to see complete details including:

- Task title and description
- Assigned staff member
- Creator
- Status
- Creation date
- Role-specific details (distributor, products, etc.)

From the view modal, you can also mark tasks as completed if needed.

## Task Status Management

Tasks can have one of three statuses:

- **Pending** - New tasks start with this status
- **In Progress** - Tasks that are currently being worked on
- **Completed** - Tasks that have been finished

You can change a task's status by:
1. Clicking the "Mark as Completed" button (check icon) in the task list
2. Opening the task details and using the "Mark as Completed" button there

## Understanding Task Creators vs. Assignees

- **Creator** - The user who created the task
- **Assignee** - The user responsible for completing the task

In the "Internal Tasks" tab, you're specifically viewing tasks where Marketing Staff or App Developer users are the creators.

## Mobile App Integration

Marketing Staff and App Developers using the mobile app can:

1. Create internal tasks
2. View tasks assigned to them
3. Update task status
4. Delete their own tasks

When they create tasks from the mobile app, these will appear in the "Internal Tasks" tab in the admin panel.

## Best Practices

- Use the "All Tasks" tab for a complete overview of all system tasks
- Use the "Internal Tasks" tab to monitor and manage tasks created by field staff and app developers
- Use task filters to find specific tasks quickly
- Check the "Internal Tasks" tab regularly to stay updated on field staff and app developer activity
- Use the task detail view for comprehensive information about each task
